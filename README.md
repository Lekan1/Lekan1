Iâ€™m a FullStack (FrontEnd-Heavy) Dev. based in Lagos, Nigeria.
Iâ€™m a student of Geology (study of the earth) at the University of Lagos Nigeria, i enjoy creating and designing things that live on the internet. I also love taking complex problems and turning them into simple and beautiful websites. I also love the logic and structure of coding and always strive to write elegant and efficient code.

i have experience working remotely building meaningful and productive software with also the ability to work with minimal supervision as i have the zeal to tackle any problems i might encounter independently to achieve the desired result. when iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me gaming (pes) ðŸŽ® or designing on figma absolutely love that application shoutout to the figma team you guys are amazing
